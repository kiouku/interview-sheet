<h1>Previous experience</h1>
<h2 id="AndroidResearch">Android developer</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Situation</strong>: I worked as an Android developer for the e-learning research team within the artificial intelligence
        department. They were trying to conduct a research about how people with visual impaired can interact with the mobile
        devices whose main input mecanishm is through a screen interaction and in particular in the field of serious games
        on Android platform. At that time, on Android 4.0 there was no support to develop accesible games
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Task</strong> At first there was no clear goal. Just to develop a accessible minesweeper prototype to acquire a basic
        knowdedge of developing Android applications and how we could solve the design challenges that involve to develop
        a game with an effective feedback mecanishm for blind people.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Action:</strong> Given the uncertanty of the project we decided to use scrum as a methodology to reduce the feedback
        cycle and incrementally develop different game prototypes: Mineweeper, simplistic golf game, find a target on the
        screen, text adventure game...After the first two game protopypes we noticed we could extract common functionality
        and helpers to a framework to help to develop games for blind people. Each of the game prototypes we contributed
        with some feature: Minesweeper -> TTS and haptic feeback or Zarddnik -> 3D sound feedback.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Result:</strong> In the end as an outcome of the project we developed 4 games that are published on Google play and
        the framework.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="TVVOD">VOD - TV Application developer</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Situation:</strong> I worked as a C++ software engineer for a telecommunications company (mirada)in the company's
        product called Inspire. There were two components: a middleware and a GUI written using c++, qt and qml. The Middleware
        was used decouple our implementations from different STB providers and to implement new functionality that was not
        provided by other third parties such directly by us such as VOD support multimedia, PVR... The GUI was the product
        built on the top of the middleware using MVC.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Task:</strong> Implement VOD support in the company's middleware. At first RTSP. Later HLS was also required for
        Fox and HBO VOD catalog. So far implementation just supported traditional cable TV but no VOD protocols over the
        network. Nobody had experience with this technologies within the company.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Action:</strong> I was responsible of designing, developing and even integrating on customer site of these VOD features.
        Our video player in the middleware had to be decouple from the low level details of every protocol specific implementation
        since it could play vod, tv, multimedia video/audio. Within VOD you had to support both protocols. To solve this
        we used strategy and template method patterns to have an abstraction that allow us to have shared logic between all
        the different playback mecahism that the lower layers had to deal with. Also state pattern was used to implement
        the RTSP and HLS protocols. Also the GUI was extended to support the specific requirements of the VOD player.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Result:</strong> We manage to deploy to production our RTSP solution for Cablevision in Monterrey and Televisa in
        Mexico City. Some of the largest tv networks in Mexico under the name of Izzi. HLS solution was deployed as a pilot
        a small scale with Fox and HBO integration, again,for Cablecom and Televisa.
    </li>

        was used decouple our implementations from different STB providers and to implement new functionality that was not
        provided by directly by us such as VOD support. The GUI was the product built on the top of the middleware using
        MVC.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Task:</strong> Integration netflix in our middleware.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Action:</strong> Integrate chromium project and extend it to allow hardware decoding in our stb target plaftforms.
        This was important to support netflix playback with native decoding since software decoding with chromium barely
        reached 10 FTS.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Result:</strong> Working with other 3 engineers prototype that was showcased to management in the company.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="NavigationIntegration">Navigation Integration engineer</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Situation:</strong> I joined as Software Engineer in the IVI integration team on Here Technologies. My team was in
        charge of implementating a customer specific protocol (sort of protobuf interface)using the company's navigation
        core libraries for the premium Audi, Porsche, VW cars. This protocol was used to communicate with companies modules
        that implemented for example, the HMI or voice recognizion engine (Nuance). By the time I joined customer wanted
        to cancel the project since the current organizational model was not delivering the features on time. Also the integration
        effort was clearly underestimated. A team of high paid externals was hired to solve the problem with no good results.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Task:</strong> I had to use the company's automotive navigation libraries to implement a set of undocumented stateful
        interfaces in C++ 11. This was specially complicated in the voice search interfaces. I was one the internals hired
        to take over the untested, undocumented search voice input and haptic search features and in sort make them work
        ASAP.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Action:</strong> From that point on we organized two weekly online meetings with engineers from customer site to
        gather information regarding how they wanted to use the voice search interface. I have to informally discuss and
        agree how to extend the company's sdk with the search team to facilitate the integration of these features. One example
        is a new structured search api. Implement with tight deadlines all the business rules and implementation details
        that these interfaces required and extend the company's sdk whenever something might not be a customer specific functionality
        but rather something increases the value of the product.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Result:</strong> Customer did not cancel the project and with lots of effort, weekly releases with lots of customer
        feedback, we had one year and a half later, a functional search library that implemented all the voice and structured
        search use cases for the customer and the product was approved and shipped to be installed in the new customer premium
        cars.
    </li>
</ul>

    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Task:</strong> The code base for search integration had a lot of logic unstructured and it was untested but we still
        had to deliver new features with new people joining the team.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Action:</strong> Write integration tests as characterization that kept the code invariant whenever a particular area
        of the code had to be extended
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Result:</strong> After 1 year we develop 3 suits of tests: functional tests, unit tests and regression tests. Architecture
        implementation could be change entirely with no problem as long as the suit of tests passed.
    </li>
</ul>


<h2 id="SearchEngineer">Search engineer</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Situation:</strong> After that experience I joined the R&D Offline Search team within automotive business unit. The
        team provides c++ libraries with search algorithms (geocoding, reverse_geocoding, structured_search, one_box search,
        next_valid_character_search...) to find addresses, point of interest, POI categories, phonemes... in location data
        which is structured in an SQL database.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Task:</strong> We needed wanted to outsource the maintanance of one of our projects.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Action:</strong>I helped with the design of the interview process by providing technical questions to other engineers
        that performed interviews in our team.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Result:</strong> We are more fair with all the candidates since we appply the same kind of questions to everybody
        for the same position.
    </li>

    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Task:</strong> Extend search library with new functionality to geocode based on ids had to be implemented. The goal
        was reduce the size of the database by reusing some of the routing/common tables to implement the search instead
        of using the search index.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Action:</strong> We gather the requirements from the customer and implement the features with clear acceptance criteria.
        A particular set of functional test with several corner cases had to be working
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Result:</strong> final feature was shipped two weeks ago. Waiting for feedback.
