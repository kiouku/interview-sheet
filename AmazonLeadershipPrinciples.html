<h1>Amazon leadership principles</h1>
<h2>Customer Obsession</h2>
<p>Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders
    pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.</p>

    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Ownership</h2>
<p> Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of
    the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job". </p>

    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Invent and Simplify</h2>
<p>Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally
    aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here". As we do new things, we accept
    that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.</p>

    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Are Right, A Lot</h2>
<p>Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm
    their beliefs.</p>

<ul>
    <li>In general everyday on my job whenever I write a new piece of software I seek for feedback from others in the code review
        and design meetings </li>
</ul>

<h2>Learn and Be Curious</h2>
<p>Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to
    explore them.</p>

    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Hire and Develop the Best</h2>
<p>Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them
    throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf
    of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.</p>

<h2>Insist on the Highest Standards</h2>
<p>Leaders have relentlessly high standards - many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually
    raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services and processes. Leaders ensure that defects
    do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Think Big</h2>
Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They
think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

<h2>Bias for Action</h2>
<p>Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated
    risk taking. </p>

<h2>Frugality</h2>
<p>Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention. There are no extra points for
    growing headcount, budget size or fixed expense.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="./SoftSkillsQuestions.html#NavigationIntegration">Use Navigation integration engineer experience.Remark High paid externals (10) vs internal team (5)</a>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Earn Trust</h2>
<p>Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing
    so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark
    themselves and their teams against the best.</p>

        <a href="./SoftSkillsQuestions.html#NavigationIntegration">Use Navigation integration engineer experience. Remark after that I was promoted and moved to a R&D Search team</a>

</ul>

<h2>Dive Deep</h2>
<p>Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote
    differ. No task is beneath them.</p>

    <li>

</ul>


<h2>Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit</h2>
<p>Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting.
    Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is
    determined, they commit wholly.</p>

    setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.</p>
