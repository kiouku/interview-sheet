# Java Job Interview Questions

This file contains a number of C++ interview questions that can be used when vetting potential candidates. It is by no means recommended to use every single question here on the same candidate (that would take hours). Choosing a few items from this list should help you vet the intended skills you require.

### **Type Erasure**
Generics were introduced to the Java language to provide tighter type checks at compile time and to support generic programming.To implement generics, the Java compiler applies type erasure to:
				
* Replace all type parameters in generic types with their bounds or Object if the type parameters are unbounded. The produced bytecode, therefore, contains only ordinary classes, interfaces, and methods.
* Insert type casts if necessary to preserve type safety.					
* Generate bridge methods to preserve polymorphism in extended generic types.

Type erasure ensures that no new classes are created for parameterized types; consequently, generics incur no runtime overhead.
				
### **GC basics**			

- GC strategies and implementations
Automatic garbage collection is the process of looking at heap memory, identifying which objects are in use and which are not, and deleting the unused objects. An in use object, or a referenced object, means that some part of your program still maintains a pointer to that object. An unused object, or unreferenced object, is no longer referenced by any part of your program. So the memory used by an unreferenced object can be reclaimed. In a programming language like C, allocating and deallocating memory is a manual process. In Java, process of deallocating memory is handled automatically by the garbage collector. The basic process can be described as follows.
				
### How it works
 1. Marking: The first step in the process is called marking. This is where the garbage collector identifies which pieces of memory are in use and which are not. All objects are scanned in the marking phase to make this determination. This can be a very time consuming process if all objects in a system must be scanned.
 1. Normal Deletion: Normal deletion removes unreferenced objects leaving referenced objects and pointers to free space.The memory allocator holds references to blocks of free space where new object can be allocated.
 1. Deletion with Compacting. To further improve performance, in addition to deleting unreferenced objects, you can also compact the remaining referenced objects. By moving referenced object together, this makes new memory allocation much easier and faster.

- Generational Garbage Collection
Having to mark and compact all the objects in a JVM is inefficient. As more and more objects are allocated, the list of objects grows and grows leading to longer and longer garbage collection time. However, empirical analysis of applications has shown that most objects are short lived. The information learned from the object allocation behavior can be used to
enhance the performance of the JVM. Therefore, the heap is broken up into smaller parts or generations. The heap parts are: Young Generation, Old or Tenured Generation, and Permanent Generation.

The Young Generation is where all new objects are allocated and aged. When the young generation fills up, this causes a minor garbage collection. Minor collections can be optimized assuming a high object mortality rate. A young generation full of dead objects is collected very quickly. Some surviving objects are aged and eventually move to the old generation.

###  Stop the World Event 

All minor garbage collections are "Stop the World" events. This means that all application threads are stopped until the operation completes. Minor garbage collections are always Stop the World events. The Old Generation is used to store long surviving objects. Typically, a threshold is set for young generation object and when that age is met, the object gets moved to the old generation. Eventually the old generation needs to be collected. This event is called a major garbage collection. Major garbage collection are also Stop the World events. Often a major collection is much slower because it involves all live objects. So for Responsive applications, major garbage collections should be minimized. Also note, that the length
of the Stop the World event for a major garbage collection is affected by the kind of garbage collector that is used for the old generation space.

The Permanent generation contains metadata required by the JVM to describe the classes and methods used in the application. The permanent generation is populated by the JVM at runtime based on classes in use by the application. In addition, Java SE library classes and methods may be stored here. Classes may get collected (unloaded) if the JVM finds they are no longer needed and space may be needed for other classes. The permanent generation is included in a full garbage collection.

### **Available switches for GC** 
- The Serial GC. The serial collector is the default for client style machines in Java SE 5 and 6. With the serial collector, both minor and major garbage collections are done serially (using a single virtual CPU). In addition, it uses a mark-compact collection method. This method moves older memory to the beginning of the heap so that new memory allocations are made into a single continuous chunk of memory at the end of the heap. This compacting of memory makes it faster to allocate new chunks of memory to the heap.
The Serial GC is the garbage collector of choice for most applications that do not have low pause time requirements and run on client-style machines. It takes advantage of only a single virtual processor for garbage collection work (therefore, its name). Still, on today's hardware, the Serial GC can efficiently manage a lot of non-trivial applications with a few hundred MBs of Java heap, with relatively short worst-case pauses (around a couple of seconds for full garbage collections). Another popular use for the Serial GC is in environments where a high number of JVMs are run on the same machine (in some cases, more JVMs than available processors!). In such environments when a JVM does a garbage collection it is better to use only one processor to minimize the interference on the remaining JVMs, even if the garbage collection might last longer. And the Serial GC fits this trade-off nicely. Finally, with the proliferation of embedded hardware with minimal memory and few cores, the Serial GC could make a comeback.
					
- The Parallel GC. The parallel garbage collector uses multiple threads to perform the young generation garbage collection. By default on a host with N CPUs, the parallel garbage collector uses N garbage collector threads in the collection. On a host with a single CPU the default garbage collector is used even if the parallel garbage collector has been requested. On a host with two CPUs the parallel garbage collector generally performs as well as the default garbage collector and a reduction in the young generationgarbage collector pause times can be expected on hosts with more than two CPUs. The Parallel GC comes in two flavors.
The Parallel collector is also called a throughput collector. Since it can use multilple CPUs to speed up application throughput. This collector should be used when a lot of work need to be done and long pauses are acceptable. For example, batch processing like printing reports or bills or performing a large number of database queries.

- The Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) Collector
The Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) collector (also referred to as the concurrent low pause collector) collects the tenured generation. It attempts to minimize the pauses due to garbage collection by doing most of the garbage collection work concurrently with the application threads. Normally the concurrent low pause collector does not copy or compact the live objects. A garbage collection is done without moving the live objects. If fragmentation becomes a problem, allocate a larger heap. Note: CMS collector on young generation uses the same algorithm as that of the parallel collector.
The CMS collector should be used for applications that require low pause times and can share resources with the garbage collector. Examples include desktop UI application that respond to events, a webserver responding to a request or a database responding to queries.

- The G1 Garbage Collector
The Garbage First or G1 garbage collector is available in Java 7 and is designed to be the long term replacement for the CMS collector. The G1 collector is a parallel, concurrent, and incrementally compacting low-pause garbage collector that has quite a different layout from the other garbage collectors described previously.
