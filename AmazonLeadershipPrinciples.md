1 - Customer Obsession

Example 1
S: Working at HERE technologies. Voice recognition system integration with HERE auto SDK replacing current navigation
provider. Audi product manager needs to show to upper management results. Integration has been going on for more than a
year still things are not completely working
T: Finish integration to be shipped in the Audi A8
A: Organize workshop with Audi, Speech recognition team, Speech navigation team and Search team. Raise concerns
regarding product expectations like “take me home” “if user partial enter address“ and how our
R: After another three month we finally shipped it successfully

Example 2
S: Working at Careem. Customer facing microservices that affected the pricing and promotions. Customer support rate
increased when user tried to purchased a package
T: Figure it out what happened.
A: Actively collaborating with customer support leads to obtain ids and data. In some case we even got contacted from
customer via linkedin.
R: The problem was in an asynchonous implementation of package purchase REST entry point was storing in dynamoDB table
wrong id and

2 - Ownership
Example 1:
S: Working at HERE Technologies. We have to integrate HERE auto SDK with Audi HMI (GUI). Taking into account long term
goals in the company and our clients, Audi, Toyota, VW…
T: Taking over integration layer from external consultants.
A:
R:

3 - Invent and Simplify 
Example 1:
S: Working at HERE Technologies. Temporarily before starting new project helped map update team to be back on track with
their deliverables. There were 6 engineers working remotely from Ukraine and another 3 on site in Berlin with a broken
workflow. All of them were sharing an embedded device and deployed there
T: To implement some of the navigation map update features like finishing OTA and SD card updates using SDK.
A: Talk with team lead to actually enforce usage of integration/component test as a way of working rather than relying
on an slow ( 5min) feedback loop of deploying and manually testing that didn’t not scale and could not be enforce in
R: I successfully added the first integration tests to the project and we could unblock some of the developers on
Ukraine.

Example 2:
S: Working at Careem. Extracting promotion service from core service

R:

4 - Are Right, A Lot
Example 1
S: Working at HERE technologies. Implementing integration test framework before delivering next feature.

5 - Learn and Be Curious
Example 1
S: Changing from C++ library development to backend developer. Learning different languages to improve the way we
express the code
T:
A:
R:

6 - Hire and Develop the Best
Example 1:
S: Working at HERE Technologies.
T: Participate in hiring process of new engineers to
A:
R:

7 - Insist on the Highest Standards
Example 1:
S: Working at HERE Technologies.
T:
A: By performing code reviews and enforcing each code review to contain regression tests (component/integration tests)
so that library could be maintained and refactored by future generations of developers.
R: Libraries were more maintainable

8 - Think Big
Example 1: Booking via WhatsApp feature when sprint was over with other engineers.
Example 2: Careem. Package service initial design scalable. Applicatito instead of adding to core service we implement in quick iterations all the necessary features.

9 - Bias for Action
Example 1:
S: Working at Careem. Hot fix in captain-ride service

Example 2:
S: Working at HERE Technologies. Refactor speech module.

10 - Frugality

11 - Earn Trust
See Ownership that lead to promotion to lead engineer.

12 - Dive Deep
Example 1:
S: Working at Careem. 4-5 team size developing promotion codes related features. Product manager does not understand why
It took so long for engineers to implement some of the features. This created
A Lot of frustration and tension between product and the team.
T: Organize nforce a
A: try to implement SCRUM approach by estimating pieces of work and measuring the points in order to align expectations
and make team’s work more predictable.
R: We sucessfully worked in this setup until this year.

Example 2:
S: Working at Careem. Vault project. Picking up right encryption library.
T:
A:
R:

13 - Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
Example 1
S: Working at HERE technologies. Implementing integration test framework before delivering next feature.


14 - Deliver Results
Example 1
S: Working at HERE technologies. Started new project with Audi to support electric vehicles related features in
navigation.
T: Developed some EV features for all Audi and Toyota NA navigation systems. I was one of the lead engineers in the
team.
A: Performed code reviews, being the main contributor to those features.
R: Finished the project weeks before the expected deadline

Example 2:
S: Working at mirada. Independently of the others RSTP implementation in the company’s product IRIS.
T: Add support RTSP in order to playback video in our different frontend apps based on our library.
A: Investigate online different libraries (vlc, ffmpeg…)
R: Successful implementation deployed in production for all IRIS clients in Mexico(Televisa).
