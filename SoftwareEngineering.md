# Design smells
- Rigidity is the tendency of software to be difficult to change. 
- Fragility is the tendency of software to break in many places when a single change is made. 
- Immobility A design is immobile when it contains parts that could be useful in other systems, but the effort and risk of separating them from the original system are too great.
- Viscosity When faced with a change, developers often have several ways to implement the desired change.
- Needless repetition In short copy and pasting code throughout the system.
- Opacity Opacity is the tendency of a module to be difficult to understand. 
- Needless complexity This may very well be the most important smell of bad design.
